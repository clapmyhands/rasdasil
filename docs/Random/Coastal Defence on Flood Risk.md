[Wave tank demonstration showing the impact of coastal defences on flood risk](https://youtu.be/3yNoy4H2Z-o)

On beaches or coast, large volume of water movement such as during storm might result in flooding.
Such cases are problematic and coastal engineer are brought in to do coastal defense and help reduce impact.

Multiple models are simulated and shown:

1. Beach
Large enough water movement on a simple beach will result in water overflowing with nothing to stop it.
1. Beach with extra wall
A simple wall on top will reduce overflowing simply because of the added verticality.
The water simply have to travel/move more to overcome the wall.
1. Vertical wall with no/eroded beach
A simulation on eroded beach shows that with the removal of beach, the full amount of water hits the vertical wall straight.
This is used as a baseline.
1. Vertical wall with (artifical) sloped revetment
The artifical slope is actually a mistake as it just reduces the power needed by the water to overcome the wall.
1. Recurved wall with sloped revetment
Recurved wall is a simple concave design to redirect the energy from the wave back into itself.
1. Vertical wall with stepped revetment
Similar to sloped revetment, however stepped revetment is slightly better at reducing energy
1. Rock armour
A simple bunched up rock in front of the wall will efficiently reduce the water energy.
The wave now have to move up left right down which breaks apart the energy.
Cheap but trade off with aesthetic and other things.
1. Submerged near-shore breakwater
Instead of protecting near the beach, by trying to reduce the energy further off shore, it reduces the energy before it hits the wall.
Expensive but very effective.
Can be submerged or showing up above the waterline.
