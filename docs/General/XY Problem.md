Time and time again throughout my career so far, I've met people that does not know how to ask questions properly.

They ask
1. without providing context
2. vaguely
3. for their immediate problem/attempted solution (instead of their actual goal)
4. without mentioning what they have already tried themself

This was something I intuitively feel until it was internalized by reading this website [The XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info/).

Ever since, this website has been a constant resource I share to most people I have worked with.
