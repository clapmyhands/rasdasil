It's possible to listen to database binlog as an event stream.
The binlog events can trigger any action based on the changed data e.g. [[Cache Invalidation]] / callback.

This might seem like overkill or wasteful if only a small subset of binlog event is of interest.
However this is an easy way of adding event handling that happens on committed record.
