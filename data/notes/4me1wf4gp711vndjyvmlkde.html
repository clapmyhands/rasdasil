<p>If you outsource 90% of what your company does, the fate of the company does not lie in your hands.
If you separate the act of designing from the act of producing, the designer won't improve on producing better product.
This results in a loss of innovation.</p>
<p>Smart Engineer wants to get their hands dirty and improve things.
Outsourcing reduces risk but also removes the opportunity for engineer to improve their product and essentially cuts their job scope.</p>
<p>As an Engineer, try to fight to defend the important parts.
The one that decides the company's fate.
Like how you can outsource the frame but should not on the microchip in a toaster.
Dont try to claim every little thing that might not matter, like the fuse in a toaster.</p>
