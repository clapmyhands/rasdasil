<h1 id="xy-problem">XY Problem<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#xy-problem"></a></h1>
<p>Time and time again throughout my career so far, I've met people that does not know how to ask questions properly. Just to be clear, this includes myself, in more than one occassion.</p>
<p>I realize that we ask:</p>
<ol>
<li>without providing enough context</li>
<li>in an indirect/vague manner</li>
<li>for our immediate problem/attempted solution (instead of our actual goal)</li>
<li>without mentioning what steps we have already tried ourself</li>
</ol>
<p>This was something I intuitively feel until it was internalized by reading this website <a href="https://xyproblem.info/">The XY Problem</a>.</p>
<p>Ever since, this website has been a constant resource I share to most people I have worked with.</p>
<p>The solution is therefore to provide direct and upfront context about what we are trying to achieve, what steps we have done, and what is the difference between what we find compared to what we expected.</p>
<p>Others are therefore able to help us by giving a better approach if there's any, explain the mistakes in any of our approach, or tell us whatever other steps we are missing.</p>
<p>This saves the back and forth of drilling down toward the actual problem and saves everybody's time.</p>
